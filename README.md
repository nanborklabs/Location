# Location
This is an android app we are building
it gets realtime location of a vehicle(Bus transit) from server 
and displays it on UI(Google map)
Features:
 * Get user's location, calculate their time to reach their Bus stop(Bus stop is  a lat,lng Co-ordinate)
 
 * get the realtime Location of vehicle from server, calculate time to reach for uses's bus stop and notify them if bus has left.
 (Adding future pick up support(if organisations provide),to pick up overall users in an area ,who have missed their bus/vehicles.
 
 
 NOTE: i am amateur developer :P,any help would be gladly appreciated.
